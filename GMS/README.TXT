1) registering members who can be singles or families
2) applying special discounts to some members
3) Registering members in physical activity classes and services
4) Displaying invoices and related search results.
The GMS has two types of members: single and family. The member class is a super-class abstract that has the common attributes and methods in all types of members. 
The two sub-classes SingleMember and FamilyMember each extends the superclass and define other more specific attributes and methods.
